With 3 valves there are 8 possibles combinations.

This can be represented using a box for each valve, a gray box is a valve down:

The same way a scale can be represented as a vertical mosaic to play from top to bottom.
 
Black is used to mimic the black keys on a piano.

Following are some scales, the column on the left is the chromatic scales from Fa#3 to Mi6.

Major scales:

Why doing this?
- Reading such mosaic scale is much easier than reading notes, you don't even need to be able to read music 
- You have a better visualisation of interval between notes
- The reverse notation helps thinking down going up and thinking up going down

That being said this is just for fun, also worth reading:
